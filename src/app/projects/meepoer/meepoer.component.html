        Meepoer is an AI powered social media posts generator. (Named after the
        infamous Dota2 Hero Meepo). Check out the repo here:

        Meepoer was inspired by some of the newer technologies I played around
        with during my previous work term. The idea was to utilize GPT-3 (which
        just came out at the time) to build a tool for sales and marketing.
        Which transitioned into building a social media post generator late on.
        <br />
        <br />
        Imagine you just built a great product and now you want to advertise it
        on different social media platforms, instead of having someone create 10
        different social media accounts to showcase your product, Meepoer can do
        that for you within seconds.
        <br />
        <br />
        Here is a brief overview of Meepoer and what it can accomplish

        Meepoer currenly supports Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook.
        Besides generating content social media, it could also help writing
        Youtube captions, blogs, emails, etc.

      process look like. The overall generation process follows:

      Let's first, put it in simpler terms.
      To generate a post, we first need inputs from the user, they could be
      <li>
        &emsp; Some texts describing what the post is about
      </li>
      <li>
        &emsp; Images that depicts the type of content you want.
      </li>
      <li>
        &emsp; Post URLs from Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, etc.
      </li>
      We will then use the analyzed result to search similar images and captions within our database. After finding a few matches, we will generate captions and hashtags for the post, combined with the image(s), and your post is ready to go !

      This was our team's first season into FTC. We were still fumbling around
      and figuring/trying out a lot of things.
      <br />
      <br />
      It was also the very first time I realized, besides the technical part,
      there are much more things that I must consider as a leader.
      <br />
      <br />
      I started developing skills such as time management, budget management,
      task management.
      <br />
      <br />
      The most painful lesson I learned is probably how to properly deal with
      arguements. Small conflicts are inevitable in a long term group
      colloboration. But if we don't sort these conflicts out in time, they will
      build up, and one day it might just be detrimental issue.
      <br />
      <br />
      By detrimental issue, I mean the "team is completely falling apart and
      disbanding" kind of issue.

      (1) Knock down the correct particle corresponding to your team color.

      (2) Decode the encrypted message hidden in the pictures, and place a glpyh
      in the grid with the correct column corresponding to the encrypted
      message.

      (3) Park the robot into the triangular area under the grid.

      Controll period:

      (1) Put glpyhs into the grid. Completed rows and columns will give extra
      points. If the whole grid is filled with one of the pre-designed pattern,
      we get full point.
      <br />
      <br />
      (2) Grab the beacon and drop onto the recovery zone outside of the arena.
      The robot itself cannot leave the arena. Full point will be given if the
      relic is placed upright on the furthest zone.

      (3) Balance the robot on the balancing zone.

      Throughout this season, we expanded our team, did a lot more community
      outreaches, started keeping our engineering notebook.
      <br />
      <br />
      We were also awarded the Rockwell Collins Innovate Award during the
      provincial championship.
      <br />
      <br />
      I was pretty proud of the team throughout the season, I feel like we
      accomplished a lot. It was really fun we go to Victoria for tournament
      everytime, I can still remember the monsters we were chugging down the
      night before championship.
